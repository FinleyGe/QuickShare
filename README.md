# QuickShare

[简体中文](./doc/README-zh-CN.md)

QuickShare is a tool, which is used to share something.

Upload a file, and it will return a
temporary/permanent link
that any one could download the file from it.

You can deploy it on your own server.
As it has a [RESTful API](./doc/api.md),
you can use it to deploy your own image hosting service.
